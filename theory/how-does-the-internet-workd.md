# How does the Internet works ?

The internet is in reality more simple than what we think
This is mostly cables buried underground
* Fiber optics
* Copper
* Satelite
Its a conexion from Server A to Server B allowing them to communicate 
the webpage are stored in a server and asking for a page is just asking for a IP adress of a page storedin the network

## How the loop of information works

1. Your computer
2. YOUR ISP SERVER
3. Your Friends ISP SERVER
4. Your friends computer

Informations are divided into packets then sent, once they arrive they are rearange to their former state to be read how they are supposed to be read

Routers make sure eah information goes to the right  computer for every query in a system
